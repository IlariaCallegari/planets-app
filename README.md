## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Desktop-first workflow
- [React-router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS-in-Js (JSS)](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.7.1) - For styles

### Continued development

During this challenge I've realised I need to focus more in understanding how to use React's costum hooks in more efficiently.
