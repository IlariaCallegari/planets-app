## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React-router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS-in-Js (JSS)](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.7.1) - For styles

### Continued development

While coding this challenge, I've niticed I need to focus more in understanding how to use React's costum hooks more efficiently.
I also need to think in advance how to structure the HTML template, to make the app responsive quicker. I also need to focus more in planning in advance how I will stucture the code - i.e. how to best use the state hook API- to make the writing process quicker and efficient.
