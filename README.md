## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each planet page and toggle between "Overview", "Internal Structure", and "Surface Geology"

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React-router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [CSS-in-Js (JSS)](https://cssinjs.org/?v=v10.7.1) - For styles

### Continued development

While coding this project, I've noticed I need to focus more in understanding how to make use of React's costum hooks more efficiently.

Also spending more time planning in advance how I will stucture the code - i.e. how to best use the state hook API, how to best structure the HTML markup - to make the writing process quicker and more efficient would be beneficial.
